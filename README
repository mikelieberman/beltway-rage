Beltway Rage
------------

The Capital Beltway, I-495, which circles Washington DC, is home to
some of the absolute worst traffic in the US.  Every single day,
without fail, there are horrible backups and slowdowns, morning, noon
and night.  You might wonder, what are all those people doing while
they sit in traffic?  What are their hopes, wants and wishes?  And who
is the *angriest* of them all?

Let's find out!  Beltway Rage monitors traffic conditions on the
Beltway and other DC metro area roads.  It then listens for tweets
originating from the roads and finds the most hilarious ones by
performing sentiment analysis.
